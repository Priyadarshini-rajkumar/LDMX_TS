1) what is the difference between simhits and digi files?
- Simhit files contains info on energy deposited in the bar information 
- Digi files contains info on photo electrons
2) Check secondaries for events for upstream true_num > downstream true_num:
- Done: not much correlation
3) Why values do not add up in SVM histogram?

4) Learn about Random forest parameters.

5) Create efficiency/underprediction/overprediction plots for new response values?
So far, efficiency does not seem to improve much for min of count clusters

6) check why overprediction curves are weird
